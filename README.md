# Poverty in Colorado

A study on homelessness in Denver, Colorado.

## Project Purpose
The past two or three decades have witnessed a startling rise in the number of Americans living in poverty. This complex issue has a multitude of contributing factors, but our team will zero in on five key areas to explore potential correlations: Income, poverty, employment, housing, and homelessness/hunger. While there may be a surface-level inclination to believe a strong "yes" exists between poverty and each of these factors, a more nuanced approach is required.  Before jumping to conclusions or perpetuating stereotypes, we must meticulously analyze the data and translate it into clear visualizations. It's crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two factors appear to be linked doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. Through rigorous analysis and objective data exploration, we hope to paint a clearer picture of the multifaceted relationship between poverty and these specific areas of our society.
