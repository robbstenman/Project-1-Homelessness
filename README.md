# Poverty in Colorado

A study on homelessness in Denver, Colorado.

## Project Purpose
The past two or three decades have witnessed a startling rise in the number of Americans living in poverty. This complex issue has a multitude of contributing factors, but our team will zero in on five key areas to explore potential correlations: Income, poverty, employment, housing, and homelessness/hunger. While there may be a surface-level inclination to believe a strong "yes" exists between poverty and each of these factors, a more nuanced approach is required.  Before jumping to conclusions or perpetuating stereotypes, we must meticulously analyze the data and translate it into clear visualizations. It's crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two factors appear to be linked doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. Through rigorous analysis and objective data exploration, we hope to paint a clearer picture of the multifaceted relationship between poverty and these specific areas of our society.

## Questions to be addressed
Our overarching question is "How did we get here"?

Poverty

Housing:
* Is income keeping pace with the average price of rent?
* Is there a correlation between the cost of rent, the value of home ownership, and the average monthly housing expense with a mortgage?
* Is there a correlation between the average year of homes built and the population of the five largest counties (by population) and the five smallest counties (by population)?

Employment

Income

Homelessness


## Overview of data collection, cleanup and exploration process

## Approach taken to achieve goals

## Observation 1

## Housing Observation:
Is income keeping pace with the average price of rent?

The analysis of income trends compared to the average price of rent involved plotting data on median household income, the average cost of rent and utilities, and all data combined. This data was sourced from the U.S. Census, providing a comprehensive view of income and housing cost dynamics over time. Through visualizations and numerical analysis, we aimed to determine whether income growth is in line with the rise in average rent and utilities.

The findings from the analysis provide insights into the relationship between income and housing costs. By examining the plotted data, we can discern whether income levels are keeping pace with the increasing average price of rent and utilities. A consistent or increasing trend in income aligned with a similar pattern in rent and utilities would suggest that income is indeed keeping pace with housing costs. On the other hand, if the trend in housing costs outpaces income growth, it indicates potential challenges in housing affordability.

## Housing Observation: 
Is there a correlation between the cost of rent, the value of home ownership, and the average monthly housing expense with a mortgage?

To assess the correlation between the cost of rent, the value of home ownership, and the average monthly housing expense with a mortgage, data was gathered from the U.S. Census focusing on variables such as "Average Monthly Housing Expense with Mortgage," "Median Contract Rent," and "Average Value of Owner-occupied Home." The data was then processed using grouping and averaging the relevant variables by year. This approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis of trends over time and facilitated the examination of potential correlations between these housing-related metrics.

The analysis revealed interesting insights into the relationships between housing costs, home values, and mortgage expenses. There was a strong positive correlation between the cost of rent and average monthly housing expenses with a mortgage, indicating that as rental prices increase, so do mortgage expenses for homeowners. Additionally, a moderate positive correlation was observed between home values and average monthly housing expenses with a mortgage, suggesting that higher home values are associated with higher mortgage payments. These findings emphasize the interconnectedness of housing and homeownership expenses.

## Housing Observation:
Is there a correlation between the average year of homes built and the population of the five largest counties (by population) and the five smallest counties (by population)?

The analysis aimed to determine if there is a correlation between the average year of homes built and the population of the five largest counties and the five smallest counties, both categorized by population size. The data for this analysis was gathered from the U.S. Census, focusing on variables such as "Average Year Home Built," "Total Population," "County," and "Year." We were able to extract and group the data, separating it into urban and rural areas based on the counties' population sizes.

Upon analyzing the data, distinct trends were observed between the average year of homes built and the population of counties. In the five largest counties, there appeared to be a correlation between population size and newer home construction, indicated by a trend of decreasing average year of home construction as population size increased. Conversely, in the five smallest counties, there was a different trend, suggesting that smaller populations were associated with older homes on average. These findings highlight potential patterns in housing development and population distribution, which can be valuable for urban planning, real estate, and demographic studies.

## Problems Encountered

Poverty

Housing:

* An issue identified in the U.S. Census data pertained to the year 2020. Initially attributing the negative integer to data errors, it was later revealed that the anomaly stemmed from the pandemic's impact on data collection during that period.

Homelessness
